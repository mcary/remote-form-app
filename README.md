Rails Remote Form Demo
======================

Rails makes form AJAX form submission easy using a featured called "remote
forms".

This repository demonstrates how to use the feature.  See
[commit 3ecc85cc39](https://github.com/mcary/remote-form-app/commit/3ecc85cc39421f0edf1bacaf1477c20442afd8d2)
in particular.  See the
[Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#form-for)
for more info.

I created this because it look me longer than it should to find the
docs to do this.  I guess I never got the Google search quite right.
This seems like a common feature that should be easy to do.
